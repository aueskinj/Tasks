# Tasks App with Python and Flask
Welcome to the Tasks App! This project is about creating a web application using Python and Flask. 
It involves building your own web applications by leveraging the power of Flask, templates, WTForms, and SQLAlchemy.
##Steps

- Forms
Learn about WTForms and integrate forms into your Flask application to gather user input.

- POST Requests
Handle form submissions using POST requests and process the data.

- SQLAlchemy
Integrate SQLAlchemy into your app to work with databases and learn about the benefits of using an ORM.

- Updating and Using the Database
Implement database models and perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on your data.

- A Note on Creating the Database
Understand how to set up the database schema and create necessary tables.

- Updating the Templates
Update the templates to display data from the database dynamically.

- Edit Route
